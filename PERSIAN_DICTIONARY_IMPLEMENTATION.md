# Persian Dictionary Mode Implementation

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Input Detection (`utils/inputDetection.js`)
- **Updated `isSingleWord()`** function to properly detect single words in both Latin and Persian scripts
- **Modified `analyzeInput()`** to trigger dictionary mode for both Dutch and Persian single words
- Added Unicode range validation `\u0600-\u06FF` for Persian characters
- Added proper Latin alphabet detection for Dutch words

### 2. Unified Dictionary Service (`services/openaiService.js`)
- **Created `buildDictionaryPrompt(word, lang)`** function that handles both languages:
  - `lang === "nl"`: Dutch word → returns `farsiMeaning`, `synonyms`, `antonyms`, examples in Dutch/Farsi/English
  - `lang === "fa"`: Persian word → returns `dutchMeaning`, `synonyms`, `antonyms`, examples in Farsi/Dutch/English
- **Updated `getDictionaryDefinition()`** to accept a language parameter and use the unified prompt builder

### 3. Updated Bot Logic (`bot.js`)
- **Modified `handleTranslationMode()`** to pass the detected language to the dictionary service
- Both Dutch and Persian single words now trigger dictionary mode with appropriate language context

### 4. Enhanced Message Formatting (`utils/messageFormatter.js`)
- **Updated `formatDictionaryResponse()`** to handle both response formats:
  - Shows `dutchMeaning` for Persian words
  - Shows `farsiMeaning` for Dutch words
  - Properly formats examples regardless of source language
- **Updated help message** to reflect that both Dutch and Persian single words work in dictionary mode

## 🎯 Results

### Before:
- ✅ Dutch single word: "huis" → Dictionary mode (Dutch → Farsi meaning, synonyms, examples)
- ❌ Persian single word: "خانه" → Translation mode (only basic translation)

### After:
- ✅ Dutch single word: "huis" → Dictionary mode (Dutch → Farsi meaning, synonyms, examples)
- ✅ Persian single word: "خانه" → Dictionary mode (Persian → Dutch meaning, synonyms, examples)

## 🧪 Testing Results
All test cases pass for:
- Dutch single words → dictionary mode
- Persian single words → dictionary mode  
- Dutch sentences → translation mode
- Persian sentences → translation mode
- Mixed/invalid input → appropriate handling

## 📱 User Experience
Users can now:
1. Send single Dutch words like "huis" and get full dictionary definitions
2. Send single Persian words like "خانه" and get full dictionary definitions  
3. Both return JSON format with meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences
4. All other input (sentences) continues to work as translation mode

The bot maintains backward compatibility while adding the requested Persian dictionary functionality.
